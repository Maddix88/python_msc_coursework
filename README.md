My MSc coursework project for python module

Coursework project from my MSc Data Science course: "The power of electronic word of mouth: can game developers use the language of critic's reviews to conclusively evaluate the quality of their gaming products?"

This coursework involves a project proposal which explores the data collected from Opencritic.com.

The final project is contained in one notebook, but the initial code for the project is broken down into to separate notebooks- one for the exploratory data analysis section and a section for the training of the regression models with unit testing applied.

The data acquired is property of opencritic.com.
